<p>Skateboarding is a sport that involves riding and performing tricks using a skateboard. Skateboarding can also be considered a recreational activity, an art form, a job, or a method of transportation. Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years. A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8 billion in annual revenue with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world.</p>
<p>Some of the my favorite skateboarders include Tony Hawn, Nyjah Huston and Andy Anderson.</p>
<p>I started skateboarding a few years ago and every since then I have tried to go as often as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing to do is go to a mini ramp in Lehi.</p>
